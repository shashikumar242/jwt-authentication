//     üîç Reasons why POST is preferred:
// Reason	Explanation
// 1. It performs a side effect	Logging out changes session state by removing the token cookie ‚Äî that‚Äôs a side effect, not a "read-only" operation.
// 2. Avoids CSRF attacks	Some browsers allow cookies to be sent with GET requests from malicious sites. A POST requires intent and is safer with sameSite policies.
// 3. Aligns with REST principles	Actions that modify state (like logout) should not be GET. POST is the right verb.
// 4. Consistent with login	Login is also a POST, since it sets a cookie or token. Logout being a POST mirrors that flow.
